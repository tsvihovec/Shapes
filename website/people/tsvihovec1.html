        <h1>Tyler Svihovec</h1>
        <p>There once was a dog who had many friends.</p>
        <p>He would act as a sort of hype man for his friends as he watched them chase cats.</p>
        <p>Then one day his friends asked if he wanted to chase cats with them.</p>
        <p>The dog agreed and began to chase a cat.</p>
        <p>He chased for so long that he eventually became lost and became afraid that he wouldn't find his home.</p>
        <p>He searched for so long that he became hungry and found the nearest cafe to eat.</p>
        <p>It turns out that he found a cat cafe and was overjoyed at the amount of cats to chase that he wasn't afraid anymore.</p>
        <p>Eventually his friends found him and all was well.</p>
        <p>The End.</p>
